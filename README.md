## Installation

To install this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use this project, you can either run the main.py file or import the modules in your own Python scripts. For example, to run the main.py file, you can use the following command:

python main.py

# To import the modules, you can use the following syntax:

from algorithms import sorting, searching, dynamic_programming
from data_structures import linked_list, stack, queue, tree, graph

# Algorithms
This project contains the following algorithms:

Sorting: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort
Searching: linear search, binary search, interpolation search, jump search, exponential search, fibonacci search
Dynamic programming: longest common subsequence, longest increasing subsequence, matrix chain multiplication, 0-1 knapsack, coin change, edit distance, rod cutting, egg dropping, optimal binary search tree

# Data structures
This project contains the following data structures:

Linked list: singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list
Stack: array-based stack, linked list-based stack
Queue: array-based queue, linked list-based queue, circular queue, priority queue, deque
Tree: binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, segment tree, fenwick tree, trie
Graph: adjacency matrix, adjacency list, breadth-first search, depth-first search, topological sort, shortest path, minimum spanning tree

# Tests
This project contains unit tests for the algorithms and data structures using the pytest framework. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

pytest
